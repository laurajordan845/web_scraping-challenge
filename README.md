# web_scraping-challenge
Module 11 Challenge for Laura Jordan

## Description
This challenge was designed to strengthen the core skills we've been working on in this bootcamp - collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights. In addition to those core skills, a couple new elements were included in this challenge. This challenge included newly learned skills of web scripaing and identifying HTML elements. As part of this assignment, I extracted information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.

This assignment consisted of 2 technical products.
* Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
* Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
In this portion of the challenge, I used automated browsing to visit a Mars news site and identify the elements I wanted to scrape. I created a Beautiful Soup object to extract the text elements from the site. I then extracted the titles and teaser text of the news articles I scraped. All dictionaries were then stored in a Python list.


## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
In this portion of the challenge, I used automated browsing to visit a Mars weather site and identify the elements I wanted to scrape. I created a Beautiful Soup object scrape the data in the HTML table so I could assemble the information into a Pandas DataFrame. 

The second step to Part 2 was to analyze the data that I extracted from the Mars weather table. There were 5 business questions that I was asked to look at and answer, 3 of them included creating visualizations to help support the answer. 

## Support
I attended class, attended a tutoring session, watched class recordings and reviewed my notes for the support needed for this challenge assignment.
